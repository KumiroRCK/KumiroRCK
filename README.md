# 👋 Hi, I’m @KumiroRCK

- 💼 I work as **IT Manager at Agedis S.r.l.**, where I take care of infrastructure, data analytics, ERP systems and digital transformation projects.  
- 🎮 I’m also a **Game Designer & Narrative Designer**, passionate about creating immersive worlds, compelling stories, and innovative gameplay experiences.  
- 👀 My interests span from **Digital Ethics & Cybersecurity** to **Creative Writing** and **Interactive Storytelling**.  
- 🌱 Currently learning **Python** and experimenting with other languages and tools to bridge IT and Game Development.  
- 📫 You can reach me at **f.antobenedetti@tanukiverse.it** (or send me a pigeon 🕊️).  
- 😄 Pronouns: **He/Him**  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don’t aim to be “just a Developer” — I want to **design systems, stories, and experiences**.

✨ This repository is special because it reflects both sides of my work:  
**IT professional by day, Game/Narrative Designer by night.**
